You are permitted to open an additional browser tab to navigate the official Kubernetes documentation assets. Those pages include https://oreil.ly/w0vib, https://oreil.ly/XLYLj, and https://oreil.ly/1sr3B plus their subdomains. You are allowed to create bookmarks and open them during the exam as long as they fall within the URLs just mentioned.
While having the Kubernetes documentation pages at hand is extremely valuable, make sure you know _where_ to find the relevant information within those pages. In preparation for the test, read all the documentation pages from start to end at least one time. Donâ€™t miss out on the search functionality of the official documentation pages.
