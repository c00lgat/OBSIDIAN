## Sleep
26MIN nap = %34 performance increase
24HR sleep deprivation = %36 performance decrease

Lack of sleep causes:
Lower attention
Worse judgement
Memory decline
Lowered mood 
Poor logical reasoning
Motor skills decrease
Immune system builds up when sleeping. Deprivation lowers immune system

How much sleep? As much as I can. 8 hours is not necessarily standard. Just sleep as much as the body requires.  

Naps are very important. 25 minute naps are good. 

## Exercise
Aerobic is more important for the brain than strength building. 
Aerobic increases blood flow throughout the body, better nutrient uptake and toxic removal. Allows the brain to make more connections.
Work out x2 per week -> %50 less chance to get dementia.

Walking 20 minutes a day (over 60) reduces the chance of Alzheimer's by %30.

## Stress
Cortisol, Adrenaline and Norepinephrine are the stress hormones.
Stress increases risk diabetes, insomnia, cancer, high blood pressure, GI problems.
Increases depression.
Unhealthy weight loss/gain. 
Adrenaline scars blood vessels. 
Cortisol damages hippocampi cells.

## Diet
Carbs: nowadays people consume about 300-500 grams a day. 
Carbs are basically sugars. 50 grams a day MAX is recommended.

Fats: Saturated and unsaturated. We do some unsaturated fat. 
Saturated fats can lead to clogging in arteries.
Unsaturated fats come from omega3 or omega6. Avocados, fish, nuts. 

Proteins: Meat, chicken, turkey, fish. 
Made out of amino acids. They make up the proteins aka the building blocks of proteins. 
Tryptophan pre-cursor of dopamine and serotonin. Green leafy veggies have decent quantities of Tryptophan. 
Different foods have different amounts of different amino acids. 
Fruit juice spikes blood sugar. Its basically fruit without the pulp and the fibers. 

Vitamins/minerals: most vegetables have most vitamins you need. 
Supplements. Omega3 supplement.
Ginko Biloba makes your brain more focused. 
Tyrosine, B12, Tryptophan... 

Drinks: Herbal tea, water.

Omega3 and Omega6. Creation and maintenance of brain cells. 
B6, B12 and folic acid help fight oxidants. 
Carbs: starch, sugar and fiber. 
Oats and grains have slower sugar release, sustaining better focus for longer as opposed to white bread that causes a spike in blood sugar and then a dip which causes us to lose focus. 

Protein, amino acids, fats, glucose.

Can also simply use pieces of paper where you take a piece of paper and write down all of what you know about this particular topic from memory.
Can draw it as a mind map. 

![[Pasted image 20230716153916.png]]

# ELABORATION
![[Pasted image 20230716154256.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230716154331.png]]
Comparing and contrasting between two ideas. How are they different? And how are they similar?

# MNEMONICS

![[Pasted image 20230717100931.png]]

Create your own pneumonias. Keys. 
The more emotionally charged memories are, the stronger they are.
Create a story using the pneumonias. 

---

# MEMORY PALACE

Have to find a location. A place that we are very familiar with. 
Visualize going and walking through the place/rooms.
Assign different items to different rooms.
Create a story linking each items to each room.
We can add as many room as we want to our memory palace.

---

# MINDMAP BASICS

We have to put a central topic right in the middle and attach other ideas to it. Pen and paper. Reading the mind map can be done in a clock wise direction.
![[Pasted image 20230717102446.png]]

Going deeper into the branches, the more branching out can be done, dividing ideas further and further. Going for more than 3 sub-divisions is not recommended, chances are if we have to go beyond 3 sub-divisions then that topic needs its own mind map.
Key words and imagery. Imagery is key since images are easier to remember. 

![[Pasted image 20230717102511.png]]
Thicker branches going out of the center, thinner ones branch out. 
Different colors = different colors.
Branches can be words. Triggers.
One word per branch. 
Personalize it as much as we want. As vivid and emotional as we can. 
Keys, colors, imagery etc. can be used to make it more memorable.

# Create your own mind map

We start with a topic that we want to mind map. 
![[Pasted image 20230717105724.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230717105827.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230717103724.png]]
We start in the center. Topic of interest is health. Then we have the main branches and then sub-branches.

Gotta keep one word per branch. 
We could add side-notes as well. For example: adding the following note to the exercise branch:
![[Pasted image 20230717103933.png]]
Reduces Alzheimer's disease.

# Speed reading

## What you need to do before you start reading 

Looking at the contents of the book first things first. Gives an idea what the book is about. Reading each chapter's title. 
Read every single title. 
Read the sub-titles of each chapter.

Jumping to a chapter and reading the introduction to the chapter could give us a more general idea to each chapter.

Skimming through every page. Reading bullet points. Reading the tips.

![[Pasted image 20230717104903.png]]
When reading a book, starting from top to bottom is the way to go. 
Depending on the book. Not recommended for text books where every piece of information is important. 

Knowing what is important. Knowing how to extract the important pieces of information.

## Speed reading: Part 1

www.Spreeder.com
You can put a text and then tell it how many words per second you want to be displayed so that we can practice. We can also control how many words per line we want. Perfect for us to actually see what our focus/capacity is.

Average is 3 words at a time. 

Fast reading and high comprehension.

Average person reads 200-250 words per minute.

Applying these techniques can get us to 400 words per minute reading.
The key is having high comprehension. The more comprehension, the more the information gets inside our brains.

Practicing constantly how to speed read could increase our WPM comprehension and reading speed. 
Eye movement is called saccades. Jittery movement of the eye.
Just looking at sentences with our peripheral vision will in return have very low levels of comprehension. Just looking at sentences one at a time will not make us comprehend as good. It also depends on the material itself. Molecular chemistry is not the same as a novel.

We can train our brains and eyes to jump from chunks to chunks of words at once. Not reading word by word but rather 2-3 words at once. Dividing each sentence/row into a few chunks.

What we do is the following: we grab our book. We know we can capture a certain amount of words in each chunk. We draw imaginary lines, dividing each row into a fixed number of chunks and then use the movement of our eyes to jump from one chunk to another.
We have to figure out what our capacity is. Do not use peripheral vision.

## Speed reading: Part 2

Fast reading and high comprehension
Learning brand new material, is best done at a fixed, nice and slow paced reading. It is advised not to speed read when learning new material. 
Research material that we are familiar with, speed reading can be used. Same goes for novels. 
We do not want to speed read stuff that we don't really understand. 

- Go at the right pace.
- Time yourself.
- Make sure there are no distractions. We cant speed read while listening to music/multitasking. We have to be focused.
- Know your purpose. Know the purpose of what we are reading. Why are we reading this book/piece of information. Getting an idea what the topic is about. 
- Don't re-read. Keep reading through or we will lose that flow. We want at least %90 comprehension.
- Slow your speed of reading if we didn't comprehend what we just read.
- After reading an important paragraph, take notes. The purpose is to absorb more knowledge. One of the key ways is applying the techniques we learned in this class. Recalling, summarizing, etc.
- Using your finger. We could use a card, moving it downwards after jumping lines. 
- Grabbing a novel, newspaper, etc. to practice speedreading. 
- Reading first and last sentences of paragraphs. Main pieces of information are usually in the first and last sentences in the paragraph/chapter. First sentence is what the chapter/paragraph is about and the last sentence is usually the conclusion. 


## Speed reading: Example with a book PART1

How a healthy brain is the key to happiness and better health
https://www.amazon.com/Train-Your-Brain-Success-Happiness/dp/1532375026

First we look at the chapters in the beginning of the book to get a general idea about the topics and main ideas in the book. 

Prefaces are usually good about what the book is about and how this book came to be.

Introductions are usually about a story that tell us about the main idea of the book. For example the introduction talks about how the brain is important and powerful. The secrets of the brain. Skimming though the introduction is a good idea. 
First sentence of the paragraphs give us good amount of information. It gives us what its about.

Going to the first chapter:
Gathering a lot of information by skimming and speedreading through the sentences. Images are important. They usually sum up a page or a few. 
Knowing what we are looking for exactly helps us find the information better through the text.



## Speed reading: Example with a book PART2

Talks about the sections that we can see with our eyes as mentioned before. 
![[Pasted image 20230717121020.png]]

There is no need to focus on the blank part right before each sentence as its empty and it wastes time. (Highlighted with red)
![[Pasted image 20230717121056.png]]

We can avoid/skip the little words such as: the, is, in etc. while speedreading.
Example for 4 lines for smaller chunks of words per line:
![[Pasted image 20230717121249.png]]

We keep reading every chapter. Remember to use your finger or a card so that our eyes don't jump to the wrong lines.

While going through the chapters at the beginning of the book we get a feeling about how complex a chapter is, and we could change our speed of reading accordingly. 
We can also not go through the entire book if we found that piece of information that we are looking for.
