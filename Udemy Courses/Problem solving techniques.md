## What is a problem? 
A thing that is difficult to deal with or understand.
A situation that is unwelcome or harmful and needs to be dealt with. 
Gap between what is desired and what is happening. 

Shifting the burden:
Applying solutions to mitigate the problem. That is called symptomatic solution. 

Example: Patient's arm is in pain. Painkiller will make the pain go away but will not solve the problem.
Treating the broken arm is a fundamental solution. 

Same thing applies to management. When we see a problem, we only see the symptoms of it.
Shifting the burden, which is a symptomatic solution will not make the problem go away, similarly to painkillers given to a patient with a broken arm. The problem will keep coming back over and over again, and it could even snowball.
We need to find the root cause so that we could apply a fundamental solution.

## Root cause analysis
Procedures that organizations apply to better understand the root cause.
Finding alternatives and testing them in order to find the optimum one. And apply those as a fundamental solution.

Types of causes: physical, human or organizational. 

Example: 
Problem: Late delivery. A free delivery will not solve the problem. Applying RCA to  find the root cause and find a suitable solution that will be a fundamental solution.
Problem could be physical: delivery van broke down
Human: worker is incompetent
Organizational: insufficient workforce

## RCA process:
Step 1: define the problem. What is happening, what are the symptoms.
Step 2: Collect data: how long has the problem existed for. What systems does it affect.
Step 3: Identify possible casual factors: where is the gap and how big it is. 
Step 4: Identify the root cause(s): what caused the problem?
Step 5 Recommend and implement solutions. What are the pros and cons of the solution. We need to collect feedback regarding the solution we found.


## Module 1: Defining the problem and collecting data
1. Understand the importance of defining the problem
2. Define problems accurately
3. Use the CATWOE tool as a data collection technique
4. Recognize different data collection methods.

Defining the problem is the most important step. 
To identify it accurately, we need to find answers for the following questions: What is happening, what are the symptoms?
Sometimes, defining the problem is more important than finding the solution.

## Collecting data
We have to ask the following questions:
What evidence do we have for the problem
How long has the problem existed for
How does the problem affect the system

## CATWOE Analysis
C = Customers
A = Actors
T = Transformational process
W = World view
O = Owners
E = Environmental constraints

## Appreciation

![[Pasted image 20230718102846.png]]
Find at least 3 possible causes.
Which options should we discard or try.
Ask more questions until there are no answers.

Apply the appreciation method a few times to find all possible factors.


## Five Whys
Invented by SAKICHI Toyoda. Japanese industrialist. 
What you think VS What really is happening.

## Drill down technique
![[Pasted image 20230718103540.png]]

1. Address the problem
2. Assemble your team
3. Write down the problem on paper or board
4. Write down a statement to summarize the problem
5. Write down all factors which may lead to the problem
6. Analyze data
7. Find the smallest manageable elements of the determined factors
8. Find the root causes

![[Pasted image 20230718103716.png]]
Break down every factors until we get to the basic elements of each factor.

Ask how likely is this cause to be the major source of the issue
How easy would it be to fix or control
