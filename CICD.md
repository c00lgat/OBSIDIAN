CI is a practice of integrating code from multiple developers into a central repo or branch, multiple times per day


CI build consists of automated processes that:
run automatic code quality scan and generate report how well latest code changes adhere to good coding practives

build code and run any automated tests that are written to make sure the changes don't break any functionality

generate and publish a test coverage report

CI: Build code and testing the code, saving the image/code
If CI did not go through, we cant deploy the application to the consumers

The testing result is usually sent to the developers to get a grasp on the status of their code/application validity
