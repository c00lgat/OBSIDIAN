###### File System
There are a number of types of filesystems out there. A system might host a number of different filesystems.
Common filesystems:
- ext4 - Linux's most common
- NTFS and FAT - Windows
- HFS+ - MacOS

To check what filesystem the system is currently running, run `df`.

Virtual File System (VFS) - the bridge/layer between the filesystem and the applications.

Journaling - the ability of fault tolerance through logs
