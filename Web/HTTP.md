###### HTTP is Stateless
Every request is completely independent.
Every time we reload the page, visiting another page etc., HTTP does not remember anything about the previous transaction. 
We can look at each request as a single transaction.
 
###### HTTPS: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure
All data that is sent back and forth is encrypted via SSL.
Each time users are sending sensitive information, it should always be over HTTPS; things like credit card data, social security numbers etc. 

Nowadays, apps are enforcing HTTPS on every page, this can be done by installing an SSL certificate on the web host. 
There are different levels of certificates. 

###### HTTP Methods

*GET*
