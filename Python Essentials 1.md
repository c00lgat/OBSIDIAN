Function invocation in Python:
1. Python checks if the name of the function is legal, in other words, it browses its internal data in order to find an existing function of the name. If this search fails, Python aborts the code.
2. Checks if the function's requirements for the number of arguments allows us to invoke the function. If there was a sufficient number of arguments passed onto the function, the code aborts.
3. Python leaves our code for a moment, and goes to the function that we want to invoke and takes the arguments with it as well.
4. The function is executed. 
5. Python returns to our code from where it left off and goes on executing the rest of the code.
