Why should a company change its ways and adopt a new technology such as cloud computing over the conventional IT solutions that have been tried for years on end and they worked just fine?
Why should one migrate over to Google docs away from Microsoft Office Word?

While that argument stands; why make the switch to a complicated smartphone when the landline phone worked perfectly fine to make phone calls?

To help convey the value proposition of AWS cloud services, AWS has come up with the "Six advantages of Cloud computing":
- Trade capital expense for variable expense.
- Benefit from massive economies of scale.
- Stop guessing capacity.
- Increase speed and agility.
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers.
- Go global in minutes.


##### Capital expense (CapEx)
Or Capital Expenditure is a financial concept that refers to money that is required to acquire, improve, or maintain physical assets. When we need to replace all of our corporate laptops because our company keeps a 3-year life cycle for computers, that's a capital expense.
The problem with Capital expense is that you need a lot of money at once and pay for it in advance. 
Once the products are in use, the infrastructure is not very flexible to changing demands. 

##### Operational expense (OpEx)
Or Operational expenses, are expenses that a company incurs while conducting normal business operations. These costs include, for example, rent, office supplies, maintenance fees, insurance and utilities. 
In IT, these expenses may also include software licensing fees, leasing printers from a vendor, and paying for their maintenance contracts, internet subscriptions, and utility fees associated with keeping the IT infrastructure running (and cooled).

While both of these expenses are still very much prevalent nowadays, variable expenses are slowly making their way into corporations.
With variable expenses, your pay for what you use and for when you use it.
