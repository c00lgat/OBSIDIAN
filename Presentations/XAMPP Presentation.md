FIRST SLIDE
Hello everyone 
My name is anan, and my team consists of three other members:
Oleg, inga and ella
We collaborated and worked together using Trello, we divided some tasks and worked on others together. 

SECOND SLIDE
So the presentation is going to give you a general idea about the XAMPP tool, how it helps us, why it became a thing, cons and more.

THIRD SLIDE
So what is XAMPP?
XAMPP is a local webserver development environment. It allows us to test our code on our local machine. It is also cross-platform meaning it works on windows, Linux and MacOS.
XAMPP stands for Cross-platform, Apache, MariaDB, PHP and Perl.
XAMPP is a similar
 
FOURTH SLIDE
So why does this tool exist in the first place? How does it help us?
XAMPP makes local web development easier. How?

It makes setting up a complete local web development environment easier and more seamless

There is no need to configure the different languages and packages so that they start working together, XAMPP is a plug and play tool where you could install it and just start working.

XAMPP gives us a simple and easy to use user interface to control the different services.

FIFTH SLIDE
XAMPP was released back in Sept. 4th 2002 and is still in use.

There was a need for development environments that package all the different tools together without the need to configure each and every tool so that work together.

XAMPP also allows us to develop software regardless of the OS.

SIXTH SLIDE
Since XAMPP runs on a local webserver, usually on our personal machines, it is more prone to malware etc.

Limited customizability.

Performance wont be as good as a dedicated production server.

Version issues between the different components in XAMPP.

SEVENTH SLIDE
Searching for materials: it was not necessarily much of a challenge, but we were lucky to have Oleg and Ella on our team, whom have had experience with web development so they had a better idea about the tool and how it worked.

Time: working as a team means having to find time that is suitable for everyone and that can be challenging. 

Communication: Knowledge gaps between our team members


EIGHTH SLIDE
Communication: we worked together as a team but there is definitely room for further improvement

Time: time management can be a challenge, especially since we were given daily tasks to work on.

Trello: trello is here to help us build a workflow and divide tasks between the team members but we have yet to learn to use it more efficiently
