###### Lab - Managing Resources with Tagging

This lab is divided into two parts:
- In the **Task** portion of this lab, you will use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) to inspect the tags assigned to a number of Amazon EC2 instances. You will then use pre-provided scripts to shut down and start up a number of Amazon EC2 instances simultaneously, based on their tags.
- In the **Challenge** portion of this lab, you will be challenged to think of a way to terminate instances that fail to implement specific tags.
