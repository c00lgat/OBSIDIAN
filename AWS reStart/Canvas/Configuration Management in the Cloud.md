This lesson explores the benefits of configuration management in the cloud. It identifies AWS services that you can use to implement configuration management strategies.

In this lesson, you will learn how to:
• Describe the benefits of configuration management 

• Identify key AWS services for configuration management 

• Create a configuration management strategy



The many benefits of configuration management:
- Increase efficiency 
- Validate every change before release
- Reduce cost by removing unwanted resources
- Enforce security at every layer
- Deploy configuration changes to running instances
- Make configuration automated and repeatable


The manual configuration of distributed systems is time-consuming and error-prone, and it can lead to inconsistently configured systems. Therefore, the ability to automate, monitor, and track configuration changes is a key component of any configuration management solution.

Configuration management provides many benefits. One of the key benefits is that it enables you to launch new resources quickly and consistently in an automated or semiautomated way. It is commonly used for deploying configuration changes to running instances with increased consistency and limited server downtime

Some of the managed services and tools from AWS that customers commonly use for configuration management include AWS CloudFormation and AWS OpsWorks. The Amazon CloudWatch service complements these services by providing a monitoring service that can trigger actions when changes to your resources occur.

Many AWS customers use configuration tools to launch new EC2 instances and other resources in an automated, repeatable manner. The flexibility of the configuration management tools enables the implementation of a complete configuration management strategy.

The diagram illustrates one way in which configuration software can be integrated within an AWS architecture. Assume that you wanted to use configuration software to initialize a set of Amazon EC2 instances as web servers. The scenario details are as follows:
1. `An administrator configures a configuration server.`
	This is usually a standalone Amazon EC2 instance. The instance will host a set of templates, which describe all the applications, files, and configurations necessary to launch AWS resources. 
	
	For example, a web server template might specify how to automate the launch of an EC2 instance.
	The web server template might then specify the following for web server content: 
	 - Installation of HTTP
	 - Configuration of the web server httpd.conf file 
	 - Installation of all necessary programming language environments (such as PHP or Ruby)
	 - Creation of a directory and file structure on the EC2 instance
	 
	 The configuration server would probably contain a number of recipes for configuring dozens of different types of servers. Examples of servers include MySQL server, NAT server, Windows IIS server, Maven repository, and so on.

2. Administrator creates the configuration templates. Then, the administrator publishes them to the configuration server and checks them into a source control system for version management and change tracking.
   
3. Administrator might use any combination of custom scripting, AWS CloudFormation, AWS OpsWorks, or other similar products to describe and create AWS Cloud deployments. 

These deployments might consist of Amazon EC2 instances, virtual private cloud (VPC) configurations, databases, and other required AWS resources.


AWS provides a number of technologies for configuring and deploying your Amazon EC2 instances and other AWS infrastructure. This module will explore some of these technologies. It will also discuss approaches for combining these technologies into a comprehensive configuration and deployment strategy. Available features and resources include:
- User data – Enables you to author scripts that are run on instance launch. The use of scripts is one of the simplest approaches to configuration management. However, at the enterprise level, it becomes more difficult to manage and version infrastructure by only using scripts.
  
- Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) – By creating base images that are customized to the needs of your organization, you can pre-deploy installations and configurations into the EC2 instances that are launched from the AMI. By using this configuration method, you can potentially reduce deployment times.
  
- Configuration and deployment frameworks – Technologies such as Chef, Puppet, and Ansible enable you to configure new instances by using templates. You can update configurations dynamically in response to change.
