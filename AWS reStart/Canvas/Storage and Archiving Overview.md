`Course Project: Build a Troubleshooting Knowledge Base`

The objective is to build your own troubleshooting knowledge base, so you can take this knowledge base with you at the end of the course and use it as a valuable resource in your career.

At the end of this project, you will be able to:  
• Describe common technical challenges users face when they attempt to deploy, upgrade, and maintain AWS Cloud deployments.

• Explain how to overcome specific technical challenges by confirming and adjusting deployment configurations as necessary.

• Present troubleshooting techniques to stakeholders.
