What is an IP? 
IP stands for Internet Protocol. 

IP address is kind of a phone number. If a device wants to send another device a message, it is done through IP addresses. Without an IP address, devices cannot talk. 
So, we give them IP addresses. So that anything that is connected to the internet can talk to anything else that is also connected to the internet.


To figure out what our IP is: We can just run `ifconfig` in our terminal (Linux, MAC).

An IP consists of 4 sets of numbers and 3 dots separating each set: `192.168.1.204` for example.
Net Mask = Subnet Mask. Same thing.

How did our device get an IP address in the first place?
