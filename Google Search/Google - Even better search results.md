What was that book I read about Napoleon?
You know, that green one with the eagle on the cover?


So, our issue on hand is that we need to find this book that we vaguely remember a couple details about.

We could start by googling "napoleon book". And go to the images tab.
Google lets you filter images by color. By pressing tools once a search query has been entered, you can choose a specific color that will filter images accordingly. 


Googling "Napoleon book" sends back all the listings and pages that contain the word "napoleon" and all the ones that contain "book". 

Generally, when searching in a database for a specific query, say "Napoleon book" for example, you would want to search for "Napoleon AND book".  

One of the innovations Google has brought is the AND is there, its already implied but invisible. So when searching for "Napoleon book", you are essentially searching for "Napoleon AND book".

When searching, it is preferred that you do not type in a whole question. Using a lot of small words can mess up the search results (The, my, on, its, etc.). 

Google considers the order of words of which you search for.

There are examples where google does consider the capitalization of words. 

Punctuation is not considered when searching using google. 

Parenthesis are not considered when searching using google. There are exceptions to this. 

Google does see symbols such as # and $. 

Typing in a question can be problematic. Answer sites (yahoo answers, Quora, etc.) will be on the top of the list. As opposed to official websites such as Wikipedia etc. 

Predictive search
Stop and think about what you want to type.
Search for your answer, not for your question.


You can search for specific sentences using quotation marks ("").

"Caterpillar NOT cat" will still show results with the word cat in them. Google allows you to exclude certain words with the minus sign (-).
"Caterpillar -cat" will show results that only have caterpillar in them and exclude ones that also mention cat. We can exclude multiple values in the same search query. "Caterpillar -cat -puppets -movie". 

The OR operand has to be in capital letters. "giants myth OR mythology".
"Chico Fresno university" will show results that have Chico and Fresno and university. 
Searching for "Chico OR Fresno university" will show either Chico university or Fresno university but not both Chico and Fresno in the same result. 

Site: uk tells google that we want results from websites that come from the UK.

What is a Google Wildcard Search?

https://seodesignchicago.com/seo-blog/what-is-a-google-wildcard-search/

A wildcard is a single character (such as an asterisk or period) used to represent a set of pre-defined characters or words. They are considered as operators by the google search engine and they have certain functions.

There are two categories of search operators:
- Basic search operators: codes and symbols.
- Advanced search operators: known commands that narrow down the search results.

Partial search methods:
- *Quotes*: using quotes for exact phrase searching. If unsure of where a certain quote came from, quotes could be used to pinpoint the where exactly the quote came from.
- *Boolean* *operators*: Looking for someone called John Smith could return too many results. Adding a '+' in the search query could narrow down the search results. Example: "John Smith" + Illinois.
	- A minus sign "-" could be used to exclude a word or a phrase from search results.

__Asterisk__
When an asterisk ( * ) is used, google tries to substitute the asterisk with a relevant wildcard word in relation to the phrase or word used.
For example, if you were running a beauty blog, but unsure about how many products to write about, searching for "skin care essentials * " will allow google to substitute the asterisk ( * ) with any other word. 

__Period__
Usually used in combination with other operators or different search terms. 
- It is used to loosely group different search terms together for broad queries. Example: how.to.bake.a.cake
- To replace hyphens ( - ) and spaces used in serial numbers that are put in the search query.
- To search for source codes.

__Two periods__
Could be used for searching for a number that exists between two specific number values, such as price range or within a date. Example: $20,000..$50,000.

__"Define:"__
Defines a certain word. Could be used to find a synonym as well with the operator synonym:[keyword].

__"AND/OR"__
- "AND": when you want to search for both X and Y. Google will give pages that have both phrases together.
- "OR": when you want to search for X or Y. Google gives pages with either or information.

__Dollar sign__
Gives back pages with an item that is listed for an exact price. Example: iPhone $400.

__The percent (%) symbol__
If we want to look for a certain person called Steve in a database (CRM) we could use the % symbol. As there are different versions of Steve, we would search for "Ste%e". This search query could return the names Steve, Stephen.

__The underscore ( _ ) symbol__
Represents a single character only as opposed to the % counterpart. Looks for a single character rather than a string of characters. For example, if we were to search for "ste_e", it could return Steve, Steven, Stevenson but not Stephen.
