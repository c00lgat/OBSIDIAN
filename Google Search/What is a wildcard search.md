A wildcard is a single character (such as an asterisk or period) used to represent a set of pre-defined characters or words. They are considered as operators by the google search engine and they have certain functions.

There are two categories of search operators:
- Basic search operators: codes and symbols.
- Advanced search operators: known commands that narrow down the search results.

Partial search methods:
- *Quotes*: using quotes for exact phrase searching. If unsure of where a certain quote came from, quotes could be used to pinpoint the where exactly the quote came from.
- *Boolean* *operators*: Looking for someone called John Smith could return too many results. Adding a '+' in the search query could narrow down the search results. Example: "John Smith" + Illinois.
	- A minus sign "-" could be used to exclude a word or a phrase from search results.

__Asterisk__
When an asterisk ( * ) is used, google tries to substitute the asterisk with a relevant wildcard word in relation to the phrase or word used.
For example, if you were running a beauty blog, but unsure about how many products to write about, searching for "skin care essentials * " will allow google to substitute the asterisk ( * ) with any other word. 

__Period__
Usually used in combination with other operators or different search terms. 
- It is used to loosely group different search terms together for broad queries. Example: how.to.bake.a.cake
- To replace hyphens ( - ) and spaces used in serial numbers that are put in the search query.
- To search for source codes.

__Two periods__
Could be used for searching for a number that exists between two specific number values, such as price range or within a date. Example: $20,000..$50,000.

__"Define:"__
Defines a certain word. Could be used to find a synonym as well with the operator synonym:[keyword].

__"AND/OR"__
- "AND": when you want to search for both X and Y. Google will give pages that have both phrases together.
- "OR": when you want to search for X or Y. Google gives pages with either or information.

__Dollar sign__
Gives back pages with an item that is listed for an exact price. Example: iPhone $400.

__The percent (%) symbol__
If we want to look for a certain person called Steve in a database (CRM) we could use the % symbol. As there are different versions of Steve, we would search for "Ste%e". This search query could return the names Steve, Stephen.

__The underscore ( _ ) symbol__
Represents a single character only as opposed to the % counterpart. Looks for a single character rather than a string of characters. For example, if we were to search for "ste_e", it could return Steve, Steven, Stevenson but not Stephen.
