Statically-typed: detects type errors at compile time; if a type error is detected, the language won't allow execution of the program.

Type-safe languages limit which kinds of operations can be performed on which kinds of data. Prevents a lot of silly errors, prevents a lot of security problems. Lots of reported break-ins were due to buffer overflows, something that is impossible in a type-safe language.

Python for example, is type-safe but is dynamically typed. Meaning, type errors are caught only at run time.
C and C++ are statically typed but not type safe: they check for some type errors but do not guarantee the absence of all type errors.
Java uses a combination of static and dynamic typing to achieve type safety.
