No solution works on every problem.

Clearly define what the problem set is.
Clarify what values count as inputs.

Identify the worst case scenario.

In order to Identify the problem, we need to specify how the input is defined and what the output looks like when the algorithm has done it's job.

Break down the problem into smaller problems, where each problem can be clearly defined with an input and an output.

First, we need to ensure correctness. 
After that, we can calculate efficiency.

**Time Complexity**: how long does it take to complete a job. 
The less time, the more efficient.

**Space Complexity**: amount of memory taken up on a computer. 

A *balance* between the two complexities is usually a good way to approach solutions.

A blazingly fast algorithm won't matter if the algorithm consumes more memory than available.
