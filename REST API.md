###### How are REST APIs Stateless?
Statefulness, Statelessness. 

A <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Stateful</mark> application API or webservice is considered Stateful if it stores data from the Client on its own servers.
For example, if a Client sends username and password to the Server for authentication purposes, and the Server stores that data; then the server is Stateful.

The Server is storing data from the Client. Thus it is a Stateful API/Webservice.
