*What is the CLI?*
CLI stands for Command-Line interface. It is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer or software by typing commands.

The CLI lets us communicate with our system through commands.
As opposed to GUI based applications, where there is a user interface that gets most of the work done with a click of a button.

The shell is a program that provides an interface for users to interact with the operating system's services. 
It acts as a command interpreter, taking commands from the user via the CLI and executing them. Essentially, the shell is the environment in which the CLI operates. 

*BASH*
Bash, short for "Bourse Again Shell", is a popular shell and command language interpreter for Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS. It is the default shell for most Linux distributions and provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the operating systems.
