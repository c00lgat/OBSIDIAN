Developer Experience. 

**Impart on productivity**
A well designed and intuitive development environment can significantly *reduce the time and effort required for coding, debugging and testing*.
Streamlined *workflows* and *automation tools* further improve efficiency and allow developers to focus on creating high-quality software.

**Collaboration and Communication**
Seamless integration with *version control systems*, *issue-tracking tools*, and project management platforms enables smooth coordination and knowledge sharing.
Clear *documentation* and accessible resources contribute to better understanding and alignment within the development team.

Setting compliance and coding standards for more efficient collaboration. Such as conventions regarding the specific coding types used, dumping logs into files/centralized tool that is used by the logging team instead of the stdoutput, and more. 

**Developer Satisfaction**
Providing developers with the *tools*, *resources* and *support* they need to perform their best fosters a sense of empowerment and fulfillment.
