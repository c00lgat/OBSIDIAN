### Evolution of Cloud + Infrastructure as Code
- Infrastructure provisioned via APIs
- Servers created and destroyed in seconds
- Long-lived + mutable -> Short-lived + immutable
	- Rather than having a server that is up for years on end and is being modified, different dependencies are being installed and changed and patched. 
	- Nowadays, when a server needs to be modified, we can just spin up a brand new server with those dependencies already installed.
	- So every server in the cloud now is usually short-lived immutable thing that we are never gonna change.
